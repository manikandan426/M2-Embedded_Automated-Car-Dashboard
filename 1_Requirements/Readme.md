# Aim
       1. The main aim of this assignment is to supervise the automobile parameters like speed, distance traveled, engine temperature & oil.
       2. This venture is intended with a micro-controller, amplifier unit, float sensor, proximity sensor, LCD screen display, ADC, and temperature sensor.

# Requirements
       1. In this assignment, the proximity sensor is incorporated in the tires of the vehicle. 
       2. When the wheel rotates the proximity sensor provides the pulse to the micro-controller. 
       3. From this, we can without problems compute the RPM (revolution per minute). 
       4. The temperature sensor is brought into use to keep an eye on the temperature of the engine.
       5. The temperature sensor values are provided to the micro-controller via amplifier & ADC. ADC is just an analog to a digital interpreter.
       6. It interprets the inward bound analog signals into parallel digital signals which are provided to the microcontroller. 
       7. The micro-controller employed can be of Atmel or PIC, as both are from the flash category & are reprogrammable micro-controller.
